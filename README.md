# Gingiva-Pigmentation-Smoker-Melanosis-Classification
CLASSIFICATION OF MELANOSIS SMOKER PIGMENTATION THROUGH GINGIVA IMAGES OF SMOKERS (KNN)
Smoking is one of the causes of various diseases in the body. Smoking can also cause abnormal conditions that are pathological and physiological in the oral cavity, one of which is smoker melanosis. The clinical picture of pigmentation smoker melanosis is the presence of scattered brown spots with a diameter of less than 1 cm and is most often located on the gingiva. The data was taken by using the oral photograph image capture method using a 12MP resolution camera, provided that the object distance from the camera was 6 cm and the flash was on. By analyzing the digital image of the smoker's gingival image, the degree of gingival pigmentation was assessed based on the GPI classification proposed by Hedin which compared the area of the field and with Dummett's Oral Color Degree of Pigmentation which compared the level of color density of the melanosis smoker pigmentation. In this study, the classification process was carried out with the KNN algorithm using features resulting from digital image processing in the form of the segmentation area, the average value of the red, green and blue color levels. The classification process uses the nearest neighbor value of 3 and a p value of 2 which is used to measure the distance to the nearest neighbor using the minkowski distance formula. The results of the test data accuracy (1.0) with F1 scores for each class for test data DOPI 0 = 1.0, DOPI 1 = 1.0, DOPI 2 = 1.0, DOPI 3 = 1.0.
